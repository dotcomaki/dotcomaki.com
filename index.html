      Hey, my name's Akif. I'm 20. Honestly, I was too tired of flashy websites everyone seems to have these days. You want information? Here it is. Can't be simpler.
      You can reach out to me via <a href="mailto:dotcomakif@gmail.com">email</a> or just shoot me a text @ 'dotcomaki' on any platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's my <a href="http://github.com/dotcomaki">Github</a> where I occasionally do some projects and 
      here's my <a href="profile.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for people who like to look at me from the pov of a screener (yes, I'm talking to you, ATS). 
      Oh, almost forgot to link my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/dotcomaki/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. Connections! Am I right-? 
      My tech stack in short is fullstack development, cloud services, AI and devops. I like to do and learn pretty much everything, which makes it fun. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      I am currently a sophomore at IIT Madras and the Program Lead of <a href="https://labs.codeday.org" target="_blank">CodeDay Labs</a>. 
      I also host <a href="http://instagram.com/codeday_lucknow" target="_blank">CodeDay Lucknow</a> annually, a hackathon + best event in town.
    </p>

      Okay, enough work talk. I make <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0I5glCgpgTjz3bmINHyo7k?si=8kxOAZkHQRaqCvIb5mmSOQ" target="_blank">music</a> when I'm bored 
      and I also write a <a href="http://dotcomaki.substack.com" target="_blank">blog</a> about film, music and other things. I watch motorsport, football and whichever show is trending 
      to not have fomo. That's it, I guess. Thanks for visiting my humble abode.
