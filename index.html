      Hey, my name's Akif. I'm 20 and I'm bored of flashy websites everyone seems to have these days. Here's all the information you need about me in a simple manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can reach out to me via <a href="mailto:dotcomakif@gmail.com" target="_blank">mail@dotcomaki.com</a> or just shoot me a text @ 'dotcomaki' on any platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's my <a href="http://github.com/dotcomaki" target="_blank">Github</a> where I occasionally do some projects and
      here's my <a href="profile.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for people who like to look at me from the pov of an ATS screener.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, almost forgot to link my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/dotcomaki/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. Connections! Am I right--?<br>
      My tech stack in short is fullstack development, cloud services, AI and devops. I can also help set up and manage your day-to-day operations in addition to development.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      I am currently a junior/pre-final year at IIT Madras and the Program Lead of <a href="https://labs.codeday.org" target="_blank">CodeDay Labs</a>.
      I also host <a href="http://instagram.com/codeday_lucknow" target="_blank">CodeDay Lucknow</a> annually, the best hackathon in town.
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay, enough work talk. Here's some fun stuff about me. 
      I used to make <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0I5glCgpgTjz3bmINHyo7k?si=8kxOAZkHQRaqCvIb5mmSOQ" target="_blank">music</a> a while ago 
      and I also write a <a href="http://dotcomaki.substack.com" target="_blank">blog</a> about music and other popular media. 
        Here's my <a href="http://letterboxd.com/dotcomaki/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a> too where I occasionally review films. I love to watch motorsports and sitcoms.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's pretty much it! Thank you for visiting my digital abode :D
